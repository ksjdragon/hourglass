### Main Page
After logging in with a Google account, you are automatically redirected to this page. Here, you can view work from subscribed classes. Preferences are found in the right sidebar, while the left sidebar contains classes and class management. The left sidebar also has options to allow you to switch between displaying a calendar and displaying a list of classes. Hovering over classes in the left sidebar will highlight works from that class. Clicking on a class will filter works to only be of that class. You can filter more than one class at a time. Clicking on a work, both in calendar and class mode, will open a menu showing more details. Cards are colored according to the type of work they are.
##### Calendar Mode
Calendar mode organizes work by due date rather than by class. Pressing on a date will open the left sidebar, allowing you to choose a class to create a piece of work under.
##### Class Mode
Class mode allows you to organize work by the class it belongs to.
##### Work
Every piece of work has a confirmed:reported ratio. This is the ratio of the number of people who confirm the presence of the work to the number of people who believe that this is a false report. The creator of a work can edit fields after creation by clicking on details needed to be changed. Lastly, by marking a work as done, it is hidden from view. To disable this, go to preferences.
##### Filters
In the left sidebar, you find options for filtering. These include filtering by class or type of assignment.
### Profile Page
On this page, it is possible to edit profile details as well as create, join, and leave classes.
#### Creating a class
After filling out class details, class creators must wait for the class to be approved by administrators. Public classes can be viewed and joined by all, while private classes are hidden from others and require a code to join.
#### Joining a class
One can join a public class by searching for and then clicking on the class they want to join. Joining a private class requires that the class administrator gives you a code, which you then provide in the "Join Private Class" button.
