Everything in one place. We'll handle the organization, you handle the work.

## Usage
How to use Hourglass: 
If you find any bugs or have an idea to make this better, you can press the question mark on the sidebar.
### Main Page
After logging in with a Google account and setting up your profile, you will redirect to this page. Here, you can view work from subscribed classes. The left sidebar has three modes: Main, Settings, and Feedback.
### Main
This will allow changing modes: class mode, and calendar mode. It also allows filters for all of the subscribed classes. Hovering over classes will highlight their respective works, and clicking on a class will filter them, only displaying those filtered. You can filter more than one class at a time or filter by the type of work.
##### Calendar Mode
Calendar mode organizes work by due date rather than by class. Pressing on a date will open the left sidebar, allowing you to choose a class in which you want to create the work.
##### Class Mode
Class mode allows you to organize work by the class it belongs to. You can drag classes to reorder them.
### Settings
This will allow changing preferences, including: Theme, Default Mode, Hide Homework, Hide Done, and Hide Reported, which are fairly self-explanatory. Additionally, this allows managing classes, where you can manage, join, and create classes.
##### Manage Classes
Here, you can see details of the class. If you are an admin of the class, clicking on it will allow you to manage details about the class. Otherwise, you can leave the class by clicking the X.
##### Join Classes
Join a public class by searching for and then clicking on the class you want to join. Joining a private class requires a code provided by the class administrator, which you enter in the field provided after clicking the "Join Private Class" button.
##### Create Classes
After filling out class details, class creators must wait for the class to be approved by administrators. Public classes can be viewed and joined by all, while private classes are hidden from others and require a code to join.
### Feedback
As mentioned earlier, send us feedback here, to know what we should improve on, or things that you want to add.
##### Work
Every piece of work has a confirmed to reported ratio. This is the ratio of the number of people who confirm the validity of the work to the number of people who believe that this is a false report. The creator of a work can edit fields after creation by clicking on details needed to be changed. Lastly, by marking a work as done, it is hidden from view. To disable this, go to preferences.
##### Filters
In the left sidebar, you find options for filtering. These include filtering by class or type of assignment.
